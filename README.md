# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.



# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
📌 Prompt Engineering for Dynamic Schedule Reorganization
1. Introduction

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and structuring instructions (prompts) to guide an AI system toward producing useful, context-aware, and optimized responses.
In scheduling, prompt engineering helps the AI reassess tasks, reorganize time blocks, and suggest new priorities or breaks whenever changes occur (like cancellations).

2. Example Prompt for the Use Case

You could say:

“Here’s my updated schedule for today. Two tasks have been canceled: [Task A, Task B]. Please reorganize my remaining agenda to optimize my productivity. Suggest if I should focus on high-priority tasks, reschedule pending work, or use the freed time for rest or preparation.”

3. Advantages

✅ Saves time by avoiding manual reorganization
✅ Ensures tasks are reprioritized logically (urgent/important first)
✅ Can recommend opportunities for self-care, learning, or preparation
✅ Makes your day more flexible and resilient against disruptions

4. Disadvantages

❌ AI suggestions may not always align with personal preferences
❌ Requires accurate task input and context
❌ Risk of over-optimization (too rigid or unrealistic rescheduling)
❌ Dependence on AI could reduce personal decision-making practice

5. Expected Result

A revised agenda with optimized task order

Identification of high-priority vs. low-priority tasks

Smart recommendations such as:

“Use 30 minutes for deep work on Project X.”

“Take a short rest break before your next meeting.”

“Allocate the canceled slot for reviewing tomorrow’s agenda.”
